# ROLLA QUEST PART 2

1. Complete proximity sensor function.
2. Write Character abstract class (don't edit the functions of the child classes, e.g., characters).
3. Type hint the whole codebase (hint: try monkeytype, then do it manually!)

# Notes:
* We added some code to main that has characters in the map that you can run into.
* You need to write the functions called by main in that new code; we also test these.
* Once you have them written, give the game a play!
